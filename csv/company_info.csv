Jennifer Apple,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-apple-961a2388,Director of E-commerce at Lids,"I have been with Lids for 6 years now and have gotten to learn about the business in many ways. I started in our Macy’s Store as a store manager, moved in the the corporate office as a videographer for HR creating Training videos, then spent a few years in Operations helping the field. A little over a year ago I spent 6 months helping to build processes in our e-commerce business and then was asked to help do the same in our newly developed Branding and Collaboration department. Working on our collaborations has been a lot of fun, but the love I have for e-commerce has taken me back to begin a new role as Director of E-commerce and I am extremely excited for the challenge and to help continue to grow our online presence.

Those are my skills, but what do people say about me?

If you’re a member of my team, you will say I’m one of the best managers you’ve ever had. I challenge you, teach you what I know about e-commerce, ask questions to learn from you and support you in your daily challenges and your career goals. You know that my modus operandi is that if you make a mistake, just tell me. We will solve the problem together. I know that you will beat yourself up over the mistake, and I will not pile on to that – I know that you will learn from it. 

If we are on cross-functional teams together, I may at first seem reserved. I listen before I speak, and I bring data to help inform the team’s decisions. I bring creative thinking to problem solving, drawing on years of e-commerce experience and ALWAYS with the customer in mind. I also ask you what you think, trying to draw the best ideas out of everyone in the room. 

If you’re a vendor or agency that I’ve hired, you know that I treat you like a partner. I will hold you accountable to reach our goals, but I will give you the reins to succeed. Even though “we pay you” to work on our behalf, I know that you are human and are motivated to work harder and smarter by people who treat you well. 

If you’re an executive in the organization, you know that you can trust me. I make decisions with the customer in mind. I am uber-conscious of the organization’s P&L, tracking ad spend and revenue like a hawk. I bring new ideas and strategies to the table and execute those plans with aplomb. We have a trusting relationship where we can talk things out and challenge each other when needed. We do great things together.

Cris Cortez,https://www.linkedin.com/in/cris-cortez-a577021b6,Director of E-commerce at Ingredients Online,"I love what I do. That’s the simplest way I can explain it. I love getting up every day to work with talented people. I love interacting and collaborating with like-minded individuals in e-commerce, marketing, and operations. I love having the opportunity to impact businesses. I love finding new and innovative ways to do the same old, tired thing. And I even love putting out Monday morning fires. 

I thrive when I’m able to take a challenge or problem, measure it, devise a solution, implement it, measure the results, refine the strategy, tweak, and measure again. My brain has always operated this way, which I think fuels my passion for what I do. Reaping the benefits of good results is just the cherry on top. 😉 

Having made my way from purchasing to sales and from trade show floors to digital marketing, I’ve gotten to see it all and have had my hands in every pot. I think that amount of experience and perspective is invaluable, and I thank my lucky stars every time I look back. Anyway, as much as I love selling the products and services I believe in, I hate selling myself, so I will just say - go do something new!

And not just the cocoa in our chocolate, but in all chocolate worldwide.

Tony's Chocolonely was founded in 2005 by 3 journalists from the Dutch TV show ‘Keuringsdienst van Waarde’ after they discovered that the world’s largest chocolate manufacturers were buying cocoa from plantations that used illegal labor. Since then, we've dedicated our efforts to raising awareness of and eliminating inequality in the cocoa industry, becoming the #1 chocolate brand in the Netherlands.

With incredibly tasty chocolate, we lead by example and show the world that chocolate can be made differently: in taste, packaging and the way we do business with cocoa farmers. Starting with paying them a higher price.

Alone, we’ll end exploitation in our cocoa supply chain, but together we can change the industry across the globe. That's why we invite everyone to join our commitment. 'Cause it's only together that we'll end exploitation in cocoa.",http://www.tonyschocolonely.com/,NULL
